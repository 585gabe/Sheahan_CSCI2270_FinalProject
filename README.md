# Sheahan_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:
This project offers the user a way to get weather information from the command line in Unix. 
The program executable, when called, will then offer the user a menu. The menu has options to request weather
information about a city, store the information locally, print out all of the cities queried, find a city with
a desired temperature (or the closest in the database), and print out the cities form either lowest temperature
or highest temperature, at the user's discretion. In addition, a number of major cities in North America will 
be pre-loaded with Yahoo weather up to the minute information when the program starts. 

How to Run:
The program is ran from the command line. The user will run the executable from the command line and then
provide input for the program's menu options.

Dependencies:
The program depends on the yahoo weather API, however this is invisible to the user. No installation
of third-party software is required.

System requirements:
This program will run on any modern machine running a Linux operating system. Support is currently not 
available for other operating systems.

Open issues/bugs:
Would like to offer support for different operating systems. At this point, the code is dependent upon
the structure of the file system used in Linux and is not compatible with any other operating system.
